The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!
Greetings, Earthling! Welcome to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.
This is a living, breathing guide. If you’d like to contribute, fork us on GitHub!
This handcrafted guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.
This guide is opinionated in a way that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Python’s official documentation. You won’t find a list of every Python web framework available here. Rather, you’ll find a nice concise list of highly recommended options.
Let’s get started! But first, let’s make sure you know where your towel is.
